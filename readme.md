### My Portfolio Website

This project is a combination of what i have learned and going to learn.

The aim is to disply projects of mine to employers.

This website will be constantly updated as I learn more about Django.

I have used float grid for the layout of this website, instead of using just Bootstrap.

Javascript is for the frontend functionality of website.

This project has been SASSED(SCSS).

All static files are located in the pages app.
